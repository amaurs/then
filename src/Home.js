I am thrilled with street art around the world. I like to take 3d pictures, but most of all I love reshaping them pixel-wise with my own tools.</p>

              <p className="courier">An iterative algorithm is used to rearange the points taken from an acceptance rejection method. In this process, we calculate the centroids of the Voronoi cells generated by the set of initial points. We create a new Voronoi diagram with the centroids of the previous iteration and repeat the process until we are satisfied with the result.</p>

              <p className="courier">Having developed a way to create images that contained all the pixels. I came up with this image which maps the color cube along a hilbert curve. The idea is very simple, but strickingly beautiful. Two space filling curves are used a 3d one to touch every single color un the color cube, and then a 2d Hilbert curve to map all of the colors into a square.</p>
