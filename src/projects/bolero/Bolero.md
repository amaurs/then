# Bolero

Boleros are the quintescecial romantic songs in Mexico and other parts of latin america. I experimente in the idea of the children's game _telephone_ in which the output of a system is the input of the next and the errors multipy as the signal travels the communication line. Using a small corpus of bolero songs, I build a discrete-time Markov chain proceeding then to generate previosly unexistent sentences based on the probabilities given by the distribution of the words in the songs. THen the output is passed through a translation system to get the final utterances in english.Â
