# Hilbert

As part of the collection that explores visually captivating representations of digital color spaces, this piece harnesses the properties of the Hilbert space-filling curve. Introduced by the mathematician David Hilbert in 1891, the Hilbert curve is a fractal space-filling curve that visits every point in a given area without overlapping or leaving gaps.

In this particular work, the three-dimensional RGB color cube is mapped onto a two-dimensional Hilbert curve, which fills a square canvas. Through a bijective mapping, each pixel in the square corresponds to a unique RGB color value from the cube. The self-similar and continuous nature of the Hilbert curve ensures an efficient and organized mapping, allowing for easy visualization and manipulation of the color space.

The resulting image showcases a mesmerizing tapestry of over 16 million distinct colors, arranged in an intricate and visually appealing pattern dictated by the Hilbert curve's recursive structure. This piece not only highlights the mathematical elegance of space-filling curves but also serves as a practical tool for efficient compression, storage, and retrieval of image data.
