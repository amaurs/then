# Flood Fill

As part of the collection exploring captivating representations of digital color spaces, this piece takes a unique approach by employing a flood fill algorithm to traverse both the two-dimensional image plane and the three-dimensional RGB color space simultaneously.

The flood fill algorithm is a widely used technique in computer graphics and image processing, typically utilized for tasks such as region filling and connected component labeling. In this project, however, the algorithm is adapted to serve a different purpose: mapping colors onto pixels in a structured and visually appealing manner.

The process begins by establishing a starting point, or "seed," in both the image plane and the color space. From these initial positions, the flood fill algorithm recursively explores the neighboring points in both spaces, following a predetermined set of directions. As the algorithm progresses, it constructs two distinct sequences: one representing the order in which pixels on the image canvas are visited, and another representing the corresponding order of color values from the RGB color space.

The resulting image is a captivating visualization of the interplay between spatial and color data, where the flood fill algorithm's exploration pattern is reflected in the intricate arrangements and transitions of colors on the canvas. Each pixel's color is determined by its position in the sequence generated by the algorithm, creating a visually striking and coherent representation of the digital color space.

This piece not only showcases the versatility of the flood fill algorithm beyond its traditional applications but also invites viewers to explore the intricate relationships between spatial exploration and the vast expanse of the color spectrum. By combining the principles of recursive algorithms and the representation of color spaces, this work offers a unique perspective on the intersection of computer science concepts and artistic expression, creating a visually striking and intellectually stimulating experience for the viewer.
