# Dense

The unit circle in the complex plane, is the set of complex numbers with _modulus_ equal to one. It is equivalent to the set of (cos@, i sin@) were @ is in (0, 2Pi). One interesting question is if the (smaller) set of (cos n, i sin n) where n is a natural number is dense in the unit circle. In other words, given any irrational number in (0, 2Pi), is it possible to find a natural number such that (cos@, i sin@) is arbitrarily close to (cos n, i sin n)? This project was a visual exploration of the former question whose answer can be proven to be true.
